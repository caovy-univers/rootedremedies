    "# 🤖 Predictive Model Performance\n",
    "## How do you decide which predictive model to use?\n",
    "In this notebook, we evaluate several machine learning models to predict whether a plant has medicinal properties based on its taxonomy and other descriptive features. Below is a brief overview of the models used and how they conceptually approach the classification task:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "- **Type**: Linear model\n",
    "- **Concept**: Estimates the probability that a plant is medicinal using a weighted combination of input features.\n",
    "- **Strengths**: Simple, interpretable, fast.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: Assumes a linear relationship between features and the log-odds of the outcome; struggles with complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Decision Tree**\n",
    "- **Type**: Non-linear, rule-based\n",
    "- **Concept**: Splits the data into branches based on feature thresholds to arrive at a prediction at the leaves.\n",
    "- **Strengths**: Easy to visualize and understand; captures non-linear relationships.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: Can overfit the training data if not pruned or regularized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Random Forest**\n",
    "- **Type**: Ensemble (of decision trees)\n",
    "- **Concept**: Trains multiple decision trees on different subsets of the data and averages their predictions to reduce variance.\n",
    "- **Strengths**: More accurate and robust than a single tree; reduces overfitting.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: Less interpretable; slower than simpler models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Gradient Boosting (e.g., GBT)**\n",
    "- **Type**: Ensemble (boosted decision trees)\n",
    "- **Concept**: Trains trees sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous one using gradient descent.\n",
    "- **Strengths**: High accuracy; handles complex patterns well.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: Can overfit if not tuned properly; computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**\n",
    "- **Type**: Maximum-margin classifier\n",
    "- **Concept**: Finds the optimal boundary (hyperplane) that best separates medicinal from non-medicinal plants by maximizing the margin between classes.\n",
    "- **Strengths**: Works well in high-dimensional spaces; robust to overfitting.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: Not ideal for large datasets; performance depends on kernel choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **XGBoost**\n",
    "- **Type**: Gradient-boosted tree ensemble (optimized)\n",
    "- **Concept**: An efficient and regularized implementation of gradient boosting that adds boosting trees iteratively to correct previous errors.\n",
    "- **Strengths**: Often state-of-the-art in structured data problems; fast and scalable.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: Complex; requires tuning; less interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model captures different aspects of the underlying patterns in the data. By comparing their performance across different evaluation strategies (e.g., with SMOTE and downsampling), we aim to identify not only which models are accurate, but also which ones are most robust under real-world conditions.\n"

This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to about -5°c and can be grown outdoors in the milder areas of the country[238]. The plant grows as a shrub in frost-free climates but is usually cut back to the ground in British winters. So long as these winters are not too cold, however, it can usually be grown as a herbaceous perennial with new shoots being produced freely from the root-stock. These flower in the summer[238]. It is probably wise to apply a good mulch to the roots in the autumn[K]. It is best to cut back the stems to about 15cm long in the spring even if they have not been killed back by the frost[238]. This will ensure an abundance of new growth and plenty of flowers in the summer. The musk mallow is widely cultivated in tropical climates for its many uses[238]. There is at least one named form, selected for its ornamental value. 'Mischief' is somewhat smaller than the species, reaching a height of 50cm[238].",

Very shade tolerant, especially when young, but growth is slower in dense shade[81]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[1]. Trees succeeds in very exposed positions, even if the top is blown out by the wind the trees make one or more new tops and continue growing with no loss of vigour[11, 185]. Prefers slightly acid conditions down to a pH of about 5[200]. Prefers growing on a north-facing slope[200]. This species thrives exceedingly well in the moister parts of Britain, where it grows very quickly[11]. It is cultivated for timber in W. and N. Europe[50]. Trees are slow growing for the first few years but they are then quite fast with trees growing 60 - 100cm in height and 8cm in girth per year even when they are quite large[1, 185]. New growth takes place from early May to July[185]. Trees grow best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland and in the far west of Britain[11]. Some trees have reached heights in excess of 60 metres in 100 years in Wales and Scotland, making them amongst the tallest trees in Europe[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is rarely harmed by disease, insects or frost[1]. The crushed leaves have a fruity orange-flavoured aroma[185]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm in height. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Special Features:North American native, There are no flowers or blooms.",

         "Landscape Uses: Pest tolerant. Originally tropical, Vachellia farnesiana can succeed from the warm temperate to tropical areas, where it is naturalized at elevations up to 400 metres and cultivated up to 1,200 metres[307 , 451 ]. It is particularly well adapted to arid and semi-arid grasslands and wastelands[1093 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 32°c, but can tolerate 7 - 42°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 400 - 1,400mm, but tolerates 150 - 4,000mm[418 ]. It prefers a minimum temperature no lower than 7°c[238 ]. Whilst this species is not very tolerant of cold, being damaged by even a few degrees of frost, the variety Acacia farnesiana cavenia seems to be more resistant to both drought and frost; and is said to be able to withstand short periods with temperatures falling to around -5°c[269 ]. Prefers a light sandy loam and a very sunny position sheltered from strong winds[1 , 49 , 89 ]. Plants can grow well in pure sand[269 ]. Most species in this genus become chlorotic on limey soils, though this species is said to have some tolerance[200 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[200 , 227 , 245 ]. The species and its cultivars are highly adaptable, and are reported to exhibit tolerance to drought, high pH, low pH, salty soils, both sands and clays[269 , 1093 ]. Plants tolerate a pH range from 5.0 to 8.0[269 ]. Acacia farnesiana is an aggressive colonizer and is regarded as an invasive weed both in parts of its native range and where introduced, notably in Australia, the USA, and some Pacific and Caribbean islands[1093 ]. In Australia it is a potential weed of grasslands, invading trampled areas, particularly along watercourses[286 ]. The plant has often escaped from cultivation and has been classified as 'Invasive' in many areas[305 ]. A fast-growing plant[307 ]. In a suitable climate, the trees begin to flower from their third year[245 ]. The flowers are sweetly fragrant. Young trees produce up to 1 kilo of flowers a year[310 ]. A well-managed mature plant 10 years old can yield 9 kg of flowers each year[245 ]. Although damaged by fire, the plant usually resprouts quickly from the base[305 ]. The plant responds well to coppicing[K ]. The leaves are peculiarly sensitive to changes of weather. When a cloud obscures the sun the opposite leaflets close together and so remain until the sky brightens. They also close at night, the plant appearing to sleep until the sun rises[459 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[269 ].

         "Adhesive Dye Essential Gum Gum Ink Tannin Teeth Wood Agroforestry Uses: In suitable climates, especially in India, Irag and the Mediterranean, the plant is grown extensively as a hedge and windbreak[82 , 310 ]. The trees have also been used for erosion control in sandy soils[269 , 272 ]. A good bee plant - the flowers are highly attractive to bees[227 , 274 , 310 ]. Other Uses: An essential oil called Cassie is distilled from the flowers[229, 269]. Cassie absolute is employed in preparation of violet bouquets and is extensively used in European perfumery[269]. Cassie pomades are manufactured in Uttar Pradesh and the Punjab. A deliciously scented essential oil, it has a fragrance of violets[245]. A mature plant 10 years old can yield 9 kg of flowers each year[245]. In a suitable climate, the trees begin to flower from their third year. The perfume is extracted from the flowers in form of concrete or pomade. Macerated flowers are placed in melted purified natural fat and allowed to stand for several hours. They are then replaced by fresh flowers and the process repeated until the fat is saturated with perfume. The fat is then melted, strained and cooled. This constitutes the pomade. Odour is that of violets but more intense. Absolute is prepared by mixing pomade with alcohol (2 - 3 kg to about 4 litres) and allowed to stand for 3 - 4 weeks at about -5°C. The alcohol is then separated and distilled over. The extract obtained is an olive-green liquid with strong odour of cassie flowers[269]. Mature trees can yield about 1 kilo of flowers per year[269]. The bark and the fruit are a source of tannin and used in making dyes and inks[227]. The seedpods contain about 23% tannin[240]. The bark, in combination with iron ores and salts, is used as a black dyestuff[269]. A gummy substance obtained from the young pods is used to mend pottery[227, 269]. A mucilage can be manufactured from the gummy sap[229]. A gum exuding from trunk is considered to be superior to gum arabic in arts[269]. The woody branches are used in India as tooth brushes[269]. In suitable climates the plant is grown as a hedge[82]. The trees have also been used for erosion control in sandy soils[269, 272]. Wood - heavy, hard, durable in the soil, close-grained. Used for fencing posts, agricultural implements, pegs, woodenware etc[82, 227, 269].",

Stored seed should be scarified, pre-soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then sown in a warm greenhouse in March. The seed germinates in 3 - 4 weeks at 25°c[133]. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in individual pots in a frame[78]. Overwinter in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Fair percentage[78].",

    "## 📝 Evaluation Summary: Model Performance on SMOTE-Augmented Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the predictive capacity of various models, we applied **SMOTE to the full dataset**, balancing the number of medicinal (1) and non-medicinal (0) plant entries. We then split this balanced data into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "- **Ensemble tree models** (Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree) achieved near-perfect scores (~99% accuracy), indicating strong capacity to fit the synthetic data.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** performed noticeably worse (~58–64% accuracy), suggesting the need for non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "- Since both training and test sets included synthetic (SMOTEd) samples, the high scores **reflect memorization rather than generalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important Caveat:\n",
    "This evaluation setup does **not represent real-world performance**, as the test set includes synthetic data. For realistic evaluation, SMOTE should be applied **only to the training set**, while the test set remains untouched and imbalanced."

    "## 🧪 Evaluation Summary: Downsampled Dataset (Realistic, Small Sample)\n",
    "\n",
    "We downsampled the majority class to create a balanced dataset with 30 medicinal and 30 non-medicinal plants, then evaluated performance on a real, small test set of 16 samples (8 per class).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "- Models like **Gradient Boosting** and **Random Forest** achieved modest performance (accuracy ~62% and ~56%), while **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** hovered around 50%, equivalent to random guessing.\n",
    "- Extremely low test set size led to high sensitivity in evaluation — a single misclassified point shifts metrics significantly.\n",
    "- The performance variability highlights the **need for more samples**, especially for the underrepresented non-medicinal class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "While this evaluation offers a more realistic view than synthetic test sets, the results are too noisy to draw strong conclusions. Further data collection or alternative modeling (e.g., regression, semi-supervised learning) may be more fruitful."
